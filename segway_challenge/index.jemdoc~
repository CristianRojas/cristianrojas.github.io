= Lego Segway Challenge: an introduction to embedded control

== The Segway Personal Transporter

The Segway personal transporter is a two-wheeled, self-balanced
electrical vehicle produced by Segway, Inc. Computers and motors in
the base of the device keep the Segway upright, and the user steers
the vehicle by simply leaning in the direction she wants to
go. Gyroscopic sensors are used to detect the tilting of the device
(which indicates departure from perfect balance) and motors driving
the wheels are commanded as needed to bring the vehicule back into
balance. If you have never seen a Segway in action, please take your
time to watch the promotional video clip below.

In this tutorial, we are going to build and control a Segway-like
vehicle in LEGO Mindstorms. We will show how /control theory/ can be
used to develop simple and powerful strategies for maintaining the
vehicle in balance. We will not dive into the theory in its fullest
generality, but simply combine things you already know from high
school physics and math. This will allow us to build a model of the
vehicle dynamics and find out how the motors should be controlled to
maintain balance. In doing so, we will reinvent the so-called "PD-controller" and use it to transform measurements of the tilt angle into the
appropriate acceleration that should be supplied by the motors. We
will discuss various way of measuring the tilt angle of the device,
and show how the proposed controller can be implemented in the LEGO
Mindstorm hardware.

Afte the tutorial, we hope that you will have a basic insight into the use of control theory and that you will feel ready to make your Segway clone more than balance - to move and win the Segway challenge!
