== Introduction
[http://julialang.org Julia] is a recent high-level, high-performance, free and open-source programming language for technical computing. It has a syntax similar to other technical computing environments and possesses a number of very attractive features for the control and optimization communities: its sophisticated compiler results in run-times comparable to C, it has native support for distributed parallel execution, it includes an extensive mathematical function library, and can be executed stand-alone, in a powerful browser-based graphical notebook interface ([https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl IJulia]) or in a network-based environment which does not require any local installation ([https://www.juliabox.com/ JuliaBox]). In addition, the [http://julialang.org Julia] developer community is contributing a number of external packages through [http://julialang.org Julia]’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace.

Over the last years, several Julia packages have been developed to complement the work of control engineers. These include several toolboxes for convex and nonconvex optimization, automatic differentiation, simulation of ordinary differential equations and noncausal models, statistics, machine learning, data-driven modeling and control. Many of these tools have reached a good level of maturity, so now is an appropriate time for the broader control community to learn about them, benefit from them, and eventually contribute to their further development.

This workshop is being organized for the purpose of disseminating and promoting the [http://julialang.org Julia] language and several of its control and optimization-related packages to those who work in control theory, education and applications. Many of the talks will be hands-on, in order to provide the audience with a real, interactive [http://julialang.org Julia] experience. Participants from industry and teachers may find [http://julialang.org Julia] to be a powerful and solid alternative to commercial software. Those who do research in control and identification theory will acknowledge that the open platforms developed for these disciplines can provide a attractive means of developing and promoting their own research, by contributing to these packages with their new algorithms.

== Target audience
Anybody with an interest in exploring the possibilities of a new, open source programming environment, either for education, use in industry or promotion of new algorithms. In particular, due to the great possibilities of [http://julialang.org Julia] and its package ecosystem, we expect participants from industry, teachers and researchers, who may find these recently developed software tools to be very useful for their daily work.

== What do you need for the workshop?
A laptop or tablet with internet connection, and a Google,Linkedin or GitHub account (to access [https://www.juliabox.com/ JuliaBox]).

== Description of the talks

=== Tutorial on Julia
[http://julialang.org Julia] is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments such as Python and Matlab. [http://julialang.org Julia] combines the simplicity of Python with a more sophisticated compiler and many small improvements that make the platform easier to use and better suited for numerical computation. Unlike many scientific computing environments, [http://julialang.org Julia] is free and open source with performance that approaches C.

In this tutorial, we will cover some of essential features of the language, with an emphasis on development tools such as [https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl Jupyter/IJulia] and [https://www.juliabox.com/ JuliaBox]. Previous experience with technical computing tools such as Matlab, SciLab, Octave, Python or R is preferred, but not required.

=== Control and identification toolboxes
In this talk, we will introduce newly developed toolboxes for efficient control and identification with the [http://julialang.org Julia] language, called [https://github.com/JuliaSystems/SystemsBase.jl SystemsBase], [https://github.com/JuliaSystems/ControlToolbox.jl ControlToolbox] and [https://github.com/JuliaSystems/IdentificationToolbox.jl IdentificationToolbox]. These toolboxes are free, open source platforms constructed not only for final end users and practitioners, but also so that researchers in the field can easily implement their own control and identification techniques and attach them to the platform, thus facilitating the benchmarking, testing and promotion of reproducible research. The presentation will be in the form of a hands-on tutorial, where participants will go through examples of these tools.

=== Optimization in Julia
[https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl] is a convex optimization modeling framework in [http://julialang.org Julia]. [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl] makes it easy to describe optimization problems in a natural, mathematical syntax, and to solve those problems using a variety of different (commercial and open-source) solvers, allowing users to experiment with different formulations of an optimization
problem. [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl] translates problems from a user-friendly functional language into an abstract syntax tree describing the problem. This concise representation of the global structure of the problem allows [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl] to infer whether the problem complies with the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to pass the problem to a suitable solver. We will give an overview of how [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl] works, and demonstrate its use in a few advanced applications.

=== Research talks
Several presentations will be given about ongoing software developments around the [http://julialang.org Julia] environment on topics of interest for the control community. These talks include:

==== Pajarito Solver for Mixed-Integer Convex Optimization

[https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl Pajarito] is a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) solver package written in [http://julialang.org Julia] and integrated with the [https://github.com/JuliaOpt JuliaOpt] ecosystem. MICP problems are convex except for restrictions that some variables take binary or integer values, and as such MICP is a very rich problem class with many applications in engineering and control. [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl Pajarito] supports both mixed-integer conic programming, which encodes nonlinearities using a small set of predefined cones, and more traditional convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which encodes nonlinearities with smooth functions and uses their derivatives. Computational results support our claim that [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl Pajarito] is the fastest open-source mixed-integer convex solver. The algorithm solves MICP problems to provable optimality by constructing sequential lifted polyhedral outer-approximations of the convex feasible set to leverage the power of state-of-the-art MILP solvers. [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl Pajarito] currently supports MICPs with any mixture of second-order, exponential, and positive semidefinite cones, and is easily extensible to other types of nonlinearities. Using motivating examples relevant to control, such as mixed-integer sum of squares optimization for trajectory planning, we will cover how to model MICPs using [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl JuMP.jl] and [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl Convex.jl], and how to find optimal solutions using [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl Pajarito].

==== POMDPs.jl: a unified interface for POMDPs

The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a principled and flexible mathematical formalism for representing sequential decision problems. In a POMDP, a decision-making agent attempts to maximize the reward collected by choosing actions to manipulate the state. The agent cannot directly observe the state, but must instead make decisions based only on observations stochastically generated by the state. Though solving this class of problems is generally very difficult, a variety of approximate solution techniques have been developed. [https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl POMDPs.jl] leverages the unique features of Julia to provide a rich but simple and unified interface for expressing POMDPs, applying a variety of existing solution techniques, and developing and testing new techniques in a computationally efficient way.
